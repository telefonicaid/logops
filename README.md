# logops

Really simple and performant logger for node.js projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install logops
```

## Basic usage

```js
var logger = require('logops');

//plain strings
logger.debug('This is an example');

//util.format support
logger.info('Request %s %d %j', 'is', 5, {key: 'value'});

//Multi string
logger.warn('Something went wrong:', value);

//error to print stack traces
logger.error(new Error('Something went REALLY wrong'));

//errors as parameter to print messages only
logger.fatal('SYSTEM UNSTABLE. BYE', error);
```

## Advanced usage

### Context support

Logops supports using a context holding information about a correlator (corr), transaction (trans) and operation (op).
If you pass a context object as a first argument, those fields are also logged as separate fields.

```js
var logger = require('logops');
var context = {
  corr: 'cbefb082-3429-4f5c-aafd-26b060d6a9fc',
  trans: '110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1',
  op: 'SendEMail'
};

logger.debug(context, 'This is an example');
```

If you are holding your context information in other places, like [Domains](http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html), you don't
need to pass a context to __every__ log function. Simply override the `logger.getContext` method to let the logger to get it.

```js
var logger = require('logops');

logger.getContext = function getDomainContext() {
  return require('domain').active.myContextObject;
}

logger.debug('This is an example');
```

### Trace format

This library incorporates three flavors of trace formatting:
* "json": writes logs as JSON. This is the default value since 0.3.x
* "pipe": writes logs separating fields with pipes. This is the default value in logops <0.3.x
* "dev": for development, used if the 'de-facto' NODE_ENV variable is set to 'development'

```bash
logger.format = logger.formatters.json;
logger.debug('This is an example');
{"msg":"This is an example","time":"2015-06-11T08:36:16.628Z","level":"DEBUG","op":null,"corr":null,"trans":null}

logger.format = logger.formatters.pipe;
logger.debug('This is an example');
time=2015-06-11T08:36:16.628Z | lvl=DEBUG | corr=n/a | trans=n/a | op=n/a | msg=This is an example

logger.format = logger.formatters.dev;
logger.debug('This is an example');
This is an example
```

### Logger Level

You can set the logging level at any time. All the disabled logging methods are replaced by a noop,
so there is not any performance penalty at production using an undesired level

```js
var logger = require('logops');

// {String} level one of the following values ['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL']
logger.setLevel('DEBUG');
```

### Writing to files

This library writes by default to `process.stdout`, the safest, fastest and easy way to manage logs. It's how you execute your app when
you define how to manage logs.

This approach is also compatible with [logratate](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html) as this is how many servers and PaaS manage the logs.
Therefore you don't need to put __anything__ in your source code relative to logs, and all is done at execution time depending on the deployment.

__Recommended execution:__ Pipelining the stdout to [tee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command).
With this configuration, you write logs fully asynchronously and don't fails when the disk is full. It's also the best
performant solution

```
node index.js | tee -a ./out.log > /dev/null
```

You can also write logs synchronously and fail miserably stopping your app when the disk is full by doing

```bash
node index.js > ./out.log
```

## Customization

### Trace format

You can override the format function and manage by yourself the formatting taking into account your own environment variables by
overriding the `logger.format` function

```js
var logger = require('logops');
/**
 * Return a String representation for a trace.
 * @param {String} level One of the following values
 *      ['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL']
 * @param {Object} context Additional information to add to the trace
 * @param {String} message The main message to be added to the trace
 * @param {Array} args More arguments provided to the log function
 *
 * @return {String} The trace formatted
 */
logger.format = function myCustomFormat(level, context, message, args) {
  var str = '';
  //...
  return str;
};
```

### Output stream

If you want to pipe the output stream to any other stream in your source code, or even write to files *(not recommended)*,
you can override the stream used by this library

```js
var logger = require('logops');
logger.stream = new MyOtherSuperStreamThatDoesGreatThingsExceptWriteToDisk();
```
